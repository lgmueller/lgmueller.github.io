Goal: 

What is the best predictor of crime rate? We are using analyzing crime rates between various counties over time and evaluating if any one factor could be a predictor of crime.

Hypothesis: 

Education spending, median household income, and unemployment are good predictors of crime rates in a county. Therefore, considering these factors: 
     1. If a county's umeployment rate decreases, the crime rate will likely decrease. 
     2. If the median household income increases, the crime rate will likely decrease. 
     3. If a county's education spending increases, the crime rate will likely decrease. 

To do: 

    - Scrape data for umemployment 
    - make more graphs

Graphs to make: 

    - By year, crime rate vs each factor 
    - 

  
Interaction Factors and Machine Learning Aspect: 

Combine education spending, income, and umemployment as factors and create a model for crime rate.
